# Description

This lab contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the comment functionality.

To solve this lab, submit a comment that calls the `alert` function when the blog post is viewed.


By going to the website, we can access any post. Scrolling down the page, we see a comment submission form, which potentially allows us to carry out our attack.
